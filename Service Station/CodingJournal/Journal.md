Lab 4 was fun I learned a lot from this lab, the two main things I learned were how to use if and if-else statements in C. Branches have always been a tough topic for me whether in Java or C. The other thing I learned was how to use strcmp to compare the variable to whatever the user going to input.

The main challenge I faced was the last step in a lab activity, where the user can input a dash(-) to get no service, when I first started with lab activity I used two string method, everything went smooth until the last step for some reason it won't let me use one string, so I had to redo the entire thing using a single string method.
